  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: hind_bold
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Hind-Bold.ttf
    - family: hind_light
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Hind-Light.ttf
    - family: hind_medium
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Hind-Medium.ttf
    - family: hind
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Hind-Regular.ttf
    - family: hind_semi_bold
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Hind-SemiBold.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
